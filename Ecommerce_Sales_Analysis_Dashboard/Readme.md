### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

#### 1. Profit Margin Drop Needs Context
While revenue has grown by ~20%, profit margin dropped by ~5.5%. This may suggest cost pressures or product mix shifts.  

**Recommendations**
- Add cost breakdown charts (COGS, fixed/variable costs, discounts).  
- Quantitative target: Reduce margin decline to below −2% next period.  
- Investigate cost drivers if negative trend continues for 2+ months.  

---

#### 2. Missing Average Order Value (AOV) & Customer Segmentation
Key e-commerce KPIs like AOV, Repeat Customer %, and Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) are missing.

**Recommendations**
- Add AOV (Sales ÷ Order Count) and track monthly.  
- Include segmentation: “New vs Returning Customers.”  
- Example: Current AOV ≈ $22.97m ÷ 9,994 = $2,298; target +10% AOV growth.  

---

#### 3. Channel and Marketing Attribution
The dashboard lacks visibility into sales sources (channels, campaigns, conversion rates).  

**Recommendations**
- Add a section for Sales by Source/Medium and ROAS.  
- Set targets: ROAS ≥ 5× for paid channels; flag channels <3×.  

---

#### 4. Time-Period & Comparison Clarity
While YOY values are shown, the reporting time frame is unclear.

**Recommendations**
- Specify period clearly (YTD, Trailing 12 Months).  
- Add a rolling 12-month view and forecast trend.  
- Target: Positive YOY Sales and Profit growth for 6 straight months.  

---

#### 5. Visual Hierarchy & Layout
Current layout may appear crowded to executive viewers.

**Recommendations**
- Simplify layout: KPIs (top), performance graphs (middle), filters (side).  
- Use consistent color coding: green = growth, red = decline.  
- Align chart axes and highlight largest variances.  

---

#### 6. Forecasting & Target Tracking
The dashboard doesn’t currently track targets or future projections.  

**Recommendations**
- Introduce a “Target vs Actual” panel (e.g., Sales target $25m vs actual $22.97m = −8.1%).  
- Add forecast for the next quarter based on run rate.  
- Quantitative target: Reach $30m annual Sales (+30% growth) and maintain ≥14% margin.
